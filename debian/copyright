Comment: Embedded Project Tagaro code
 This directory contains code from Project Tagaro, which has been copied into
 the source tree of Kolf to ease porting to KGameRenderer, while Tagaro is not
 stable.
 .
 The given code has been copied from the libtagaro repository, which was, at the
 time of this writing, available from git://git.kde.org/libtagaro.git. The code
 was taken from the directories tagaro/interface/ and tagaro/graphics/ at commit
 a137e9b266dba51b3cb9fcbf32dd8a2a3a5976d5.
 .
 Code that integrates with Tagaro::MessageOverlay has been removed, and
 Tagaro::Renderer and Tagaro::RendererClient have been replaced by KGameRenderer.
